# Forecasting-a-Non-Stationary-Time-Series-using-ETS-and-ARIMA-Models
This project performs time series analysis and forecasting on the variable x using multiple baseline and advanced models, including Mean, Naive, Exponential Smoothing (ETS), and ARIMA. Exploratory Data Analysis revealed non-stationarity, requiring differencing for ARIMA modeling. The dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing, and models were evaluated using RMSE. Among all approaches, ETS achieved the lowest test error, making it the most accurate forecasting model for this series. Model diagnostics indicate reliable and well-behaved residuals.
