# Forecasting-a-Non-Stationary-Time-Series-using-ETS-and-ARIMA-Models
This project analyzes and forecasts a time series variable using Mean, Naive, ETS, and ARIMA models. After EDA identified non-stationarity, data was split 80–20 and evaluated using RMSE. ETS achieved the lowest test error, providing the most accurate forecasts.
